## What is Data Cloud?

In today's data-driven world, companies deal with vast amounts of data from many sources. If used effectively, this data can offer valuable insights, guide strategic decisions, and promote innovation. However, a major challenge they face is data fragmentation.

Data fragmentation happens when data is spread across various systems, platforms, and departments within a company.

Salesforce Data Cloud is a hyperscale data engine built into Salesforce that connects all your data and metadata, integrating seamlessly with other Salesforce products and legacy systems. It empowers your teams to engage customers at every touchpoint with relevant data and insights by transforming and harmonizing this data into a common model. This unified customer profile provides a 360-degree view of each customer, enabling calculated insights, real-time segmentation, analytics in Tableau, triggered automations, grounded AI, and much more.
