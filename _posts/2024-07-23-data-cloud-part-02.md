## Trailhead Playground

Alternatively, you can log in to your Trailhead account and sign up for a Developer Edition org.

Follow this link to the project: [Get Started with a Data Cloud Developer Edition](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/create-a-data-stream-in-data-cloud/get-started-with-a-data-cloud-developer-edition "Get Started with a Data Cloud Developer Edition").

Create a Playground to receive a special 5-day Developer Edition org (note: Trailhead mentions it as 14-day) that includes Data Cloud and sample data.
